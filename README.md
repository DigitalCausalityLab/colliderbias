# Shiny App: Collider Bias <a href="https://digitalcausalitylab.github.io/"><img src="www/logo.png" align="right" width = "120" /></a>

This shiny app illustrates the collider bias based on the movie star example in Cunningham (2021, Section 3.1.6). The app is based on [this template for an Example Shiny App on Heroku](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-docker-r-shiny-app).

This app has been developed in the context of the project [Digital Causality Lab](https://digitalcausalitylab.github.io/) at the University of Hamburg.
